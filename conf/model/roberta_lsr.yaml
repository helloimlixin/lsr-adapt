# Configuration for RoBERTa with LSR (Low-Rank Structured Reparameterization)

# Model configuration
name: "roberta-lsr"
base_model: "roberta-base"
num_labels: 2  # Binary classification for MRPC

# LSR-specific configuration
adaptation_type: "lsr"  # Identifies this as LSR vs. "lora"
lsr:
  r: 2  # Rank of the low-rank matrices (can be much smaller than LoRA due to Kronecker structure)
  alpha: 8192  # Scaling factor (typically higher than LoRA)
  target_modules: ["query", "value"]  # Which modules to apply LSR to
  num_terms: 16  # Number of Kronecker product terms
  factor_a: 32  # First factor for dimensions (32 Ã— 24 = 768)
  factor_b: 24  # Second factor for dimensions
